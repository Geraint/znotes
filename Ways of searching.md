# Ways of searching

## Using tags.

For example:

- #question
- #php
- #idea

> [!note]
> You can search all files with `CNTL + SHIFT + F`
> 
> Constrain search to tags by starting search term with `tag:` (singular) and then hit `return`
>
> You can select the tag you want with the arrow keys, and then hit `return`
> 
> You can pick the file you want with the arrow keys

## Using keywords

You should be able to find stuff easily with `Control+O`.
