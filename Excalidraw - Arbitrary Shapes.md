- Draw a line
- Double click on it (or select it and then hit `Control+Enter`)
- Hold down `Alt` and click on one of the handles
- Release `Alt` - this should create a new section of the line
- Drag the new handle wherever you want it.
- Repeat as necessary
- You can drag the last handle on to the first one to "close" the object
