# Obsidian or Vim?

Tags: #obsidian #vim #neovim #telescope

With Neovim's Telescope, I can find filenames super quickly.

I can also find tags by using Telescope's live grep for a string like `#the-tag`.

Just checking that entering #the-tag _does_ work like a tag in Obsidian.
It does.

What benefit does Obsidian bring?
